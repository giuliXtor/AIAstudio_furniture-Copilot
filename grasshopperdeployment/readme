everything you need to get the grasshopper file running.

i have included the encoding but this isnt necessary to get it to run. 

when in CopilotDeployment.gh:

steps:
0. you need xgboost installed to your rhino python. don't do #r, this will corrupt. install through pip in correct directory. 
1. set correct files:
i've circled everything that needs files in green.
within mrt prediction python component and pmv prediction component you need to point to the model and scaler .pkls. you then need to point to the json.
2. toggle run prediction and spin ur LLM and gh_server.py, toggle run for LLM in grasshopper
3. enter query or try the ones already there, slider above will change the grid you're viewing
